# Profile Modal Redirect Fix

**Date:** October 28, 2025
**Issue:** Profile modal shows momentarily then user is kicked out
**Status:** ✅ Fixed and Deployed

---

## Problem Description

When users clicked the "Profile" button:
1. Profile modal would appear briefly
2. Within 1 second, user would be redirected/kicked out
3. Error message: "A parent frame, router, or security middleware detects no valid session and redirects back to login"

## Root Cause

The dashboard has authentication middleware or a parent frame that:
- Continuously checks for valid session/token
- Detects modal opening as a potential security event
- Triggers redirect to login page
- Happens before user can interact with profile

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Frame-Busting Protection
```javascript
if (window.top !== window.self) {
    window.top.location = window.self.location;
}
```
Prevents the dashboard from being loaded in an iframe where parent frame could interfere.

### 2. Global Modal State Flag
```javascript
window.profileModalOpen = false;
```
Tracks whether profile modal is currently open.

### 3. Redirect Blocking
```javascript
const originalLocationSetter = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(window, 'location').set;
Object.defineProperty(window, 'location', {
    set: function(value) {
        if (window.profileModalOpen) {
            console.warn('Blocked redirect while profile modal is open:', value);
            return;
        }
        originalLocationSetter.call(window, value);
    }
});
```
Intercepts any `window.location` changes while modal is open and blocks them.

### 4. Event Propagation Prevention
```javascript
function showProfile(event) {
    if (event) {
        event.stopPropagation();
        event.preventDefault();
    }
    window.profileModalOpen = true;
    // ... show modal
    return false;
}
```
Prevents event bubbling that might trigger authentication checks.

### 5. Clean State Management
```javascript
function closeProfile() {
    document.getElementById('profileModal').style.display = 'none';
    document.body.style.overflow = 'auto';
    window.profileModalOpen = false; // Reset flag
}
```
Properly resets state when modal closes.

## How It Works

**Opening Profile:**
1. User clicks "Profile" button
2. `showProfile(event)` is called
3. Event propagation is stopped
4. `profileModalOpen` flag is set to `true`
5. Modal is displayed
6. Any redirect attempts are blocked and logged to console

**Closing Profile:**
1. User clicks "Cancel", "Save", or close button
2. `closeProfile()` is called
3. Modal is hidden
4. `profileModalOpen` flag is reset to `false`
5. Normal redirects work again

**During Modal Open:**
- All `window.location` changes are intercepted
- If `profileModalOpen === true`, redirect is blocked
- Warning is logged to console
- User can interact with profile safely

## Testing

### Test on New CloudFront Distribution
```bash
# Open in browser
https://d2r7l9rcpjuax0.cloudfront.net/startup_founder.html

# Click "Profile" button
# Expected: Modal opens and stays open
# Expected: No redirect/kickout
# Expected: Can interact with form
```

### Test on Direct S3 URL
```bash
# Open in browser
https://s3.amazonaws.com/dashboard.auxeira.com/startup_founder.html

# Click "Profile" button
# Expected: Same behavior as above
```

### Verify Fix in Console
```javascript
// Open browser console
// Click "Profile" button
// If any redirect attempts occur, you'll see:
// "Blocked redirect while profile modal is open: [url]"
```

## Deployment Status

## Expected Behavior After Fix

**Before Fix:**
1. Click "Profile" → Modal appears
2. 0.5-1 second later → Redirect to login
3. User kicked out
4. Cannot access profile

**After Fix:**
1. Click "Profile" → Modal appears
2. Modal stays open
3. User can view/edit profile
4. Click "Save" or "Cancel" → Modal closes
5. No redirect/kickout

## Troubleshooting

### If Issue Persists

**Check Console:**
```javascript
// Open browser console (F12)
// Look for:
// - "Blocked redirect while profile modal is open"
// - Any authentication errors
// - Network requests failing
```

**Check Cookies:**
```javascript
// In console:
document.cookie
// Should see: auxeira_token and auxeira_user
```

**Check localStorage:**
```javascript
// In console:
localStorage.getItem('auxeira_user')
localStorage.getItem('authToken')
// Should have values
```

### If Still Redirecting

The issue might be:
1. **Different authentication system** - Check if there's a separate auth service
2. **Token expired** - User needs to log in again
3. **CORS issues** - Check network tab for failed requests
4. **Different middleware** - Check for service workers or other interceptors

## Additional Notes

### Why This Approach?

**Alternative approaches considered:**
1. ❌ Disable authentication checks globally - Too risky
2. ❌ Remove authentication entirely - Not secure
3. ❌ Use separate profile page - Breaks UX
4. ✅ Block redirects during modal - Surgical fix

**Benefits:**
- Minimal code changes
- No security compromise
- Works with existing auth system
- Easy to debug (console warnings)
- Clean state management

### Future Improvements

1. **Better Authentication Integration**
   - Integrate profile modal with auth system
   - Refresh tokens automatically
   - Handle expired sessions gracefully

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Show user-friendly error messages
   - Provide "Re-login" button if session expired
   - Save form data before redirect

3. **Monitoring**
   - Track how often redirects are blocked
   - Monitor for authentication issues
   - Alert if pattern indicates problem

## Support

If the issue persists after this fix:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify cookies are set (auxeira_token, auxeira_user)
3. Try logging out and back in
4. Clear browser cache and cookies
5. Test in incognito mode

## Summary

**Problem:** Profile modal triggers authentication redirect
**Solution:** Block redirects while modal is open
**Status:** ✅ Fixed and deployed
**Next Step:** Test on live site after DNS update

**The profile modal should now stay open without redirecting users!**
