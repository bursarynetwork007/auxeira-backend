# Government Dashboard Enhancement - Design Document

## Project Overview

Transform the Auxeira Government Agency Dashboard from a data-centric platform into a **Strategy Intelligence Storytelling Platform** with AI-powered narratives, predictive analytics, and investment opportunity management.

## Enhancement Requirements

### 1. AI-Powered Narratives
- **Overview Tab**: Add AI-generated strategic narratives analyzing metrics and trends
- **Policy Tracker Tab**: Include AI-powered policy impact stories and insights
- **Technology**: OpenAI-compatible API (Gemini/GPT) for narrative generation
- **Fallback**: Pre-generated narratives when API unavailable

### 2. Tab Structure Reorganization

**Current Tabs**:
- Impact Overview
- Policy Tracker
- Program Portfolio
- Policy Opportunities
- Economic Analytics
- Benchmarking Explorer

**New Tab Structure**:
1. **Overview** - Metrics with AI narratives
2. **Policy Tracker** - Policy progress with AI stories
3. **Portfolio** - Programs and initiatives (renamed from Program Portfolio)
4. **Opportunities** - AI-matched investments + co-funding + upload modal
5. **Analytics** - Economic data and predictions
6. **Reports** - Generated reports and exports

### 3. Opportunities Tab Features

**AI-Matched Opportunities**:
- Display investment opportunities with AI match scores
- Show alignment with government priorities
- Include projected ROI and impact metrics

**Co-Funding Section**:
- List opportunities seeking co-investors
- Show funding progress and gaps
- Enable pledge/interest expression

**Investment Upload Modal**:
- Allow users to submit new investment opportunities
- Fields: Title, Description, Amount, Sector, Timeline
- Role selection: Lead Investor, Co-Investor, Advisor
- Skill set requirements selection
- Interest expression functionality

### 4. Chart Enhancements

**All Charts Must Include**:
- Historical data (past trends)
- Current data (present state)
- Projections (future predictions)
- Confidence intervals for predictions
- Interactive tooltips with narratives

**Projection Methodology**:
- Use database formulas for calculations
- Apply trend analysis algorithms
- Show multiple scenarios (optimistic, realistic, pessimistic)

### 5. Database Integration

**Formula-Based Calculations**:
- ROI = (Economic Impact - Total Investment) / Total Investment
- Job Creation Rate = Jobs Created / Investment (in millions)
- Policy Effectiveness = (Actual Outcome / Target Outcome) × 100
- Ecosystem Health Score = Weighted average of sector scores

**Data Sources**:
- Mock database with realistic formulas
- Placeholder for real database connection
- API endpoints for data fetching

### 6. X Post Scanning (AI API)

**Features**:
- Scan X (Twitter) for policy-related mentions
- Sentiment analysis of public perception
- Trend identification
- Stakeholder engagement metrics

**Implementation**:
- Use OpenAI API for sentiment analysis
- Mock X data with realistic examples
- Display in Policy Tracker tab
- Update frequency: Real-time simulation

### 7. Text Visibility Fixes

**Issues to Address**:
- Ensure all text has sufficient contrast
- Fix overlapping text elements
- Improve readability on all backgrounds
- Enhance mobile responsiveness

### 8. Footer Cleanup

**Remove**:
- "Data automatically updated every 24 hours via nano-GPT-5 and Thunderbit crawler integration"

**Replace With**:
- Simple copyright and version info
- Data last updated timestamp
- Contact information

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Components

1. **AI Narrative Engine**
   - Function: `generateAINarrative(data, context)`
   - Calls OpenAI-compatible API
   - Caches responses
   - Fallback to pre-generated content

2. **Chart Projection System**
   - Function: `addProjections(chartData, formula)`
   - Calculates future trends
   - Adds confidence bands
   - Updates charts dynamically

3. **Investment Modal Component**
   - Bootstrap modal with multi-step form
   - File upload capability
   - Validation and submission
   - Success/error handling

4. **X Post Scanner**
   - Function: `scanXPosts(keywords)`
   - Sentiment analysis
   - Trend detection
   - Display in cards

### Data Flow

```
User Action → Frontend Request → API Call → Database/AI Service → Response → UI Update
```

### API Endpoints Needed

1. **`/api/government/metrics`** - Fetch dashboard metrics
2. **`/api/government/generate-narrative`** - AI narrative generation
3. **`/api/government/opportunities`** - Investment opportunities
4. **`/api/government/opportunities/upload`** - Submit new opportunity
5. **`/api/government/x-posts`** - Fetch and analyze X posts
6. **`/api/government/projections`** - Calculate projections

## UI/UX Enhancements

### Color Scheme
- Government Blue: #1e40af
- Government Purple: #7c3aed
- Economic Green: #10b981
- Policy Gold: #f59e0b
- Terminal Blue: #00d4ff

### Typography
- Headers: Bold, gradient text
- Body: Clean, readable sans-serif
- Metrics: Large, prominent numbers
- Narratives: Comfortable reading size

### Animations
- Smooth tab transitions
- Chart loading animations
- Modal slide-in effects
- Hover state transitions
