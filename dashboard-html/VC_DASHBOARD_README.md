- **Status**: Production-ready

## Technical Details

### New CSS Classes

```css
.thesis-canvas          /* Drag-and-drop canvas */
.sector-palette         /* Grid of draggable sectors */
.sector-chip            /* Individual sector cards */
.thesis-sector          /* Sectors added to thesis */
.risk-meter             /* Visual risk indicator */
.risk-level             /* Risk percentage bar */
```

### New JavaScript Functions

```javascript
handleDragStart()           // Drag event handler
handleDrop()                // Drop event handler
updateThesisCanvas()        // Update thesis display
calculateRiskAndIRR()       // Calculate risk and returns
generateAISuggestions()     // AI-powered recommendations
uploadStartupOpportunity()  // Open upload modal
submitStartupOpportunity()  // Submit opportunity form
```

### Risk Calculation Formula

```javascript
Risk Score = (Σ risk_weights) / sector_count * 100
where risk_weights: low=1, medium=2, high=3
```

### IRR Calculation Formula

```javascript
Conservative IRR = (avg_growth * 0.6) - (risk_adjustment * 1.0)
Base Case IRR    = (avg_growth * 0.8) - (risk_adjustment * 0.7)
Optimistic IRR   = (avg_growth * 1.2) - (risk_adjustment * 0.5)
where risk_adjustment = avg_risk * 2
```

## Sector Growth Rates

| Sector | Growth Rate | Risk Level |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| AI/ML | 32% | Medium |
| Quantum Computing | 45% | High |
| Climate Tech | 28% | Medium |
| Fintech | 22% | Low |
| Healthtech | 26% | Medium |
| Cybersecurity | 35% | Low |
| Web3/Blockchain | 40% | High |
| Enterprise SaaS | 18% | Low |

## AI Suggestions Logic

The system provides three types of AI suggestions:

1. **Diversification**: Triggered when < 3 sectors selected
2. **Risk Balance**: Triggered when > 50% high-risk sectors
3. **Growth Opportunity**: Triggered when Quantum or Web3 not included
