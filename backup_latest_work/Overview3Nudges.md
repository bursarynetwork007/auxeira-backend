#### Nudge Generator Logic (Backend AI Orchestrator)
- **Trigger**: On user sign-in or SSE/MRR data update (e.g., cron every 24h).
- **Core Prompt Template** (For Gina AI, per section):
  ```
  As a design thinking epcialist and Startup Mentor, generate a single high-impact nudge for [Section: Growth/Validation/Funding] to boost [User Startup]'s SSE from [Current SSE] toward [Next Threshold, e.g., Series A at 85]. Context: [MRR Trend Summary], [Past Actions, e.g., 'Completed 3 interviews last month'], [User Stage, e.g., Seed]. Output JSON:
  - goal: Concise action title (<10 words, e.g., "Launch referral program for 25% CAC cut").
  - description: 1-sentence explainer with projected impact (e.g., "Projected 25% CAC reduction").
  - button_text: Action-oriented CTA (e.g., "Launch Now").
  - aux_reward: Integer (50-300, formula: base 75 + difficulty [low=1x/medium=1.5x/high=2x] based on est. effort: low<1h, med 1-3h, high>3h).
  - difficulty: "Low/Medium/High" (for internal logging).
  - workflow_type: "Modal/Redirect/Edit" (maps to UI flow).
  Draw from top founder/VC playbooks (YC/a16z); prioritize quick wins if SSE <60.
  ```
- **Personalization Hooks**: Infuse user signals (e.g., if CAC >$200, bias toward referrals). Rotate 2-3 variants per section quarterly via A/B.
- **Fallbacks**: If AI gen fails, default to safe templates (e.g., +100 AUX generic goal).
- **Metrics**: Track AUX redemption rate; tune difficulty if >80% completions feel "too easy."

# Behavioral-Optimized AI Nudge System with Startup-Sized Rewards

## ðŸŽ¯ **Enhanced AUX Reward Formula**

```python
def calculate_aux_reward(difficulty, startup_size, streak_bonus=0, social_bonus=0):
    # Base reward by startup size (meaningful progression)
    size_multipliers = {
        "pre_seed": 1.0,      # <$10K MRR
        "seed": 1.3,          # $10K-$50K MRR  
        "series_a": 1.7,      # $50K-$200K MRR
        "series_b_plus": 2.2  # $200K+ MRR
    }
    
    base_rewards = {
        "pre_seed": 60,
        "seed": 80,
        "series_a": 100,
        "series_b_plus": 120
    }
    
    difficulty_multipliers = {
        "Low": 1.2,
        "Medium": 1.8, 
        "High": 2.5
    }
    
    base = base_rewards[startup_size]
    size_multiplier = size_multipliers[startup_size]
    difficulty_multiplier = difficulty_multipliers[difficulty]
    
    calculated_aux = int(base * size_multiplier * difficulty_multiplier) + streak_bonus + social_bonus
    return min(calculated_aux, 500)  # Reasonable cap
```

**Example Rewards:**
- Pre-seed, Low difficulty: ~86 AUX
- Series A, High difficulty: ~425 AUX  
- Seed, Medium difficulty: ~187 AUX

## ðŸ§© **Behavioral Enhancements in Action**

### **The "Meaningful Scaling" Effect**
- **Pre-seed founder**: "Run 5 customer interviews" â†’ 115 AUX (meaningful but accessible)
- **Series A founder**: "Validate enterprise pricing with 3 Fortune 500 prospects" â†’ 380 AUX (commensurate with impact)

### **Progressional Psychology**
```python
# Creates natural career progression feeling
"Early rewards feel earned â†’ Later rewards feel deserved"
```

### **Anti-Gaming Mechanism**
The size-based multiplier prevents founders from "farming" easy tasks at later stagesâ€”the system naturally demands more impactful work as they grow.

### **Status Signaling**
Completing high-AUX tasks becomes a status signal within the founder community, creating healthy social pressure.

## ðŸ“Š **Expected Behavioral Outcomes**

1. **Increased Long-term Engagement**: Founders see the platform growing with them
2. **Appropriate Challenge Matching**: Tasks scale with founder capability and resources  
3. **Reduced Reward Inflation**: Meaningful AUX differentiation prevents point devaluation
4. **Natural Skill Development**: Progressive difficulty curve builds founder competence
5. **Enhanced Perceived Value**: Large AUX rewards for complex tasks feel earned and valuable

This system creates what behavioral scientists call "**progressive mastery**"â€”the feeling of leveling up in both challenges and rewards, which is deeply motivating for achievement-oriented founders.- **Retention Hook**: Total AUX pool scales with engagement; redeem for perks (e.g., 500 AUX = VC intro call).
- **Dev Notes**: Use JSON from Gina API to populate; cache for 24h to avoid over-querying.
