## Tab 2: Growth Metrics

### SSE Score Instances Found

#### Instance 1: Indirect Reference in Churn Rate Card
- **Location:** Monthly Churn Rate card (middle section)
- **Display Type:** Text opportunity note
- **Label:** "Opportunity"
- **Value Mentioned:** "Reducing churn to 1.5% would add ~$50K in annual revenue and significantly boost your **Series A readiness**"
- **SSE Connection:** Indirect - mentions Series A readiness (which is derived from SSE)
- **Status:** ⚠️ No direct SSE score displayed, only indirect reference

### Growth Metrics Tab Summary

**Total Direct SSE Instances:** 0  
**Indirect References:** 1 (Series A readiness mentioned in churn opportunity)

**Key Observation:** The Growth Metrics tab focuses on financial metrics (LTV, CAC, MRR, Churn, NRR) and does not prominently display the SSE score. It only indirectly references "Series A readiness" which is derived from SSE.

**Content Focus:**
- Customer Lifetime Value: $1,890
- Customer Acquisition Cost: $127
- LTV:CAC Ratio: 14.9:1
- Net Revenue Retention: 128%
- Total Customers: 1,247
- Monthly Churn Rate: 2.3%
- Monthly Recurring Revenue: $18,500
- CAC Payback Period: 2.1 months
- AI-Recommended Growth Levers section

## Tab 3: Funding Readiness

### SSE Score Instances Found

#### Instance 1: Funding Readiness Score Gauge
- **Location:** Top left, primary position
- **Display Type:** Circular gauge with numeric center display
- **Label:** "Funding Readiness Score"
- **Value Displayed:** **72** (prominently shown in center)
- **Additional Info:** 
  - "Current Score" label below gauge
  - Progress bar showing position relative to target
  - "Target: 85+ for Series A Investor Introductions"
- **Button:** "View Score Breakdown" (interactive element)
- **Status:** ✅ Numeric score clearly visible

**Note:** This appears to be a DIFFERENT metric from SSE Score:
- Overview tab shows "SSE Score" with "Series A Readiness: 78%"
- Funding Readiness tab shows "Funding Readiness Score: 72"
- These may be related but distinct metrics

#### Supporting Metrics Displayed:
- Runway (Months): 14
- Monthly Burn Rate: $12,500
- Revenue Multiple: 13.2x
- Team Size: 12

### Funding Readiness Tab Summary

**Total SSE Instances:** 1 (Funding Readiness Score)  
**Value:** 72  
**Display Quality:** ✅ Excellent - numeric value prominently displayed in gauge center

**Key Observation:** The "Funding Readiness Score" (72) appears to be distinct from the "SSE Score" mentioned in Overview tab. This creates potential confusion about which metric represents what.

**Possible Relationship:**
- SSE Score: 62 (mentioned in Overview "SSE Boost Workshop")
- Series A Readiness: 78% (shown in Overview gauge)
- Funding Readiness Score: 72 (shown in Funding Readiness tab)

These three different values suggest either:
1. Different calculation methods
2. Different aspects of readiness being measured
3. Inconsistent data display

## COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY

### SSE Score Display Across All Tabs

| Tab | SSE Instances | Display Type | Value(s) Shown | Quality |
|-----|---------------|--------------|----------------|---------|
| **Overview** | 3 | Gauge, Chart, Text | 62, 78%, ~90 | ⚠️ Inconsistent |
| **Growth Metrics** | 0 (1 indirect) | Text reference | Series A readiness | ⚠️ Indirect only |
| **Funding Readiness** | 1 | Gauge | 72 | ✅ Clear |
| **Earn AUX** | 0 | N/A | None | N/A |
| **Activity Rewards** | 0 (1 indirect) | Text reference | "success score" | ⚠️ Indirect only |
| **Partner Rewards** | 0 | N/A | None | N/A |

### Critical Issues Identified

#### 1. **Multiple Conflicting Values**

The dashboard displays different values that appear to represent the same or related metrics:

- **SSE Score: 62** (mentioned in "SSE Boost Workshop" notification in Overview)
- **Series A Readiness: 78%** (shown in Overview gauge)
- **Funding Readiness Score: 72** (shown in Funding Readiness tab gauge)
- **Chart value: ~90** (shown in Growth Trajectory chart)

**Problem:** It's unclear whether these are:
- Different metrics entirely
- The same metric calculated differently
- Different aspects of the same underlying score
- Data inconsistencies/errors

#### 2. **Unclear SSE Score Display in Main Gauge**

The primary SSE Score gauge in the Overview tab does NOT clearly display the numeric score in the center. Users must infer the value from:
- The visual gauge position
- The "Series A Readiness: 78%" text below
- The notification mentioning "SSE at 62"

**Problem:** The most prominent SSE display (the gauge) doesn't show the actual numeric score clearly.

#### 3. **Inconsistent Terminology**

Multiple terms are used that may or may not refer to the same thing:
- "SSE Score"
- "Series A Readiness"
- "Funding Readiness Score"
- "Success Score"

**Problem:** Users may be confused about what each metric represents and how they relate to each other.

#### 4. **Limited SSE Visibility Across Tabs**

Out of 6 main tabs:
- Only 2 tabs display SSE-related scores prominently (Overview, Funding Readiness)
- 2 tabs have indirect text references (Growth Metrics, Activity Rewards)
- 2 tabs have no SSE mention at all (Earn AUX, Partner Rewards)

**Problem:** The SSE score, which appears to be a core metric, is not consistently visible across the user journey.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Priority 1: Clarify Metric Relationships

**Action:** Create clear documentation and UI labels explaining:
1. What is the "SSE Score" (0-100 scale?)
2. How "Series A Readiness %" is calculated from SSE Score
3. How "Funding Readiness Score" relates to SSE Score
4. Whether these are the same metric or different aspects

**UI Fix:** Add tooltips or info icons explaining each metric.

### Priority 2: Display Numeric SSE Score in Main Gauge

**Action:** Update the Overview tab SSE gauge to prominently display the numeric score (e.g., "62") in the center of the circular gauge, similar to how the Funding Readiness gauge displays "72".

**Current:** Gauge shows visual indicator + "Series A Readiness: 78%"  
**Recommended:** Gauge shows "62" in center + "Series A Readiness: 78%" below

### Priority 3: Resolve Data Inconsistencies

**Action:** Investigate why different values are shown:
- SSE Score: 62
- Series A Readiness: 78%
- Funding Readiness: 72
- Chart trend: ~90

**Possible Solutions:**
- If they're the same metric, ensure consistent display
- If they're different metrics, clearly label and differentiate them
- If it's a data error, fix the source data or calculation

### Priority 4: Add SSE Context to Other Tabs

**Action:** Consider adding a small SSE score indicator to the header or sidebar that's visible across all tabs, so users can always see their current score.

**Example:** Add a compact "SSE: 62 | Series A Ready: 78%" widget to the top navigation bar.

### Priority 5: Standardize Terminology

**Action:** Choose one primary term and use it consistently:
- Option A: "SSE Score" (with "Series A Readiness" as a derived percentage)
- Option B: "Startup Success Score" (more descriptive)
- Option C: "Funding Readiness Score" (more action-oriented)

**UI Fix:** Update all references to use the chosen term consistently.

---

## CONCLUSION

The SSE score is displayed in **multiple locations** with **inconsistent values** and **unclear relationships** between different metrics. The main SSE gauge in the Overview tab does not prominently display the numeric score, requiring users to piece together information from multiple sources.

**Immediate Action Required:**
1. Fix the main SSE gauge to display the numeric score clearly
2. Clarify the relationship between SSE Score (62), Series A Readiness (78%), and Funding Readiness Score (72)
3. Ensure data consistency across all displays

**User Impact:**
- **Confusion:** Users may not understand their actual SSE score
- **Trust Issues:** Conflicting values may reduce confidence in the platform
- **Reduced Engagement:** Unclear metrics may reduce motivation to improve scores

**Recommended Timeline:**
- Week 1: Fix main gauge display and add numeric score
- Week 2: Clarify metric relationships and add tooltips
- Week 3: Resolve data inconsistencies
- Week 4: Add SSE indicator to all tabs
