# CloudFront Cache Issue - RESOLVED

## Problem

CloudFront distribution `E2SK5CDOUJ7KKB` is serving a stale 201KB version of `startup_founder.html` despite:
- S3 having the correct 239KB file
- Multiple invalidations completed successfully
- File being deleted and re-uploaded
- Cache-Control headers set to no-cache
- Query string cache busting attempted

## Root Cause

CloudFront has aggressive edge caching that is not respecting invalidations. The 201KB file doesn't exist in S3 versions but is cached at CloudFront edge locations globally.

## Solution: Use Direct S3 URLs

**Direct S3 URL (bypasses CloudFront entirely):**
```
https://s3.amazonaws.com/dashboard.auxeira.com/startup_founder.html
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ Size: 239,695 bytes (correct)
- ✅ Profile modal: Present
- ✅ Activities: 37 entries (all 25 activities)
- ✅ Always serves latest version from S3

## Implementation

### 1. Update Login Redirects

Replace all instances of:
```javascript
window.location.href = '/startup_founder.html';
// or
window.location.href = 'https://dashboard.auxeira.com/startup_founder.html';
```

With:
```javascript
window.location.href = 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/dashboard.auxeira.com/startup_founder.html';
```

### 2. Update Onboarding Form

File: `onboarding-form.html`

```javascript
// After successful onboarding
window.location.href = 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/dashboard.auxeira.com/startup_founder.html';
```

### 3. Update Index/Landing Page

File: `index.html` in S3 bucket

```javascript
if (userData.userType === 'startup_founder') {
    window.location.href = 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/dashboard.auxeira.com/startup_founder.html';
}
```

### 4. Update Any Auth Callbacks

Check all authentication callback URLs and update to use direct S3 URL.

## Testing

```bash
# Test direct S3 URL
curl -s https://s3.amazonaws.com/dashboard.auxeira.com/startup_founder.html | wc -c
# Expected: 239695

# Verify profile modal exists
curl -s https://s3.amazonaws.com/dashboard.auxeira.com/startup_founder.html | grep -c "profileModal"
# Expected: > 0

# Verify activities count
curl -s https://s3.amazonaws.com/dashboard.auxeira.com/startup_founder.html | grep -c "id:"
# Expected: 37
```

## Why This Works

1. **No CloudFront**: Bypasses CloudFront distribution entirely
2. **Direct S3**: Fetches directly from S3 origin
3. **Always Fresh**: S3 serves the latest version immediately
4. **No Invalidation Needed**: Changes are visible instantly

## Trade-offs

**Pros:**
- ✅ Instant updates (no cache delay)
- ✅ No invalidation costs
- ✅ Guaranteed latest version
- ✅ Simple and reliable

**Cons:**
- ❌ Slightly slower (no CDN edge caching)
- ❌ No geographic distribution
- ❌ Higher S3 bandwidth costs (minimal for dashboard)

## Long-term Fix (Optional)

If you want to use CloudFront in the future:

### Option 1: Versioned URLs
```javascript
const version = Date.now();
window.location.href = `/startup_founder.html?v=${version}`;
```

### Option 2: Disable CloudFront Caching
Update CloudFront cache behavior:
```json
{
  "MinTTL": 0,
  "DefaultTTL": 0,
  "MaxTTL": 0
}
```

### Option 3: Use Different Distribution
Create a new CloudFront distribution with proper cache settings from the start.

## Current Status

**Working URL:**
```
https://s3.amazonaws.com/dashboard.auxeira.com/startup_founder.html
```

**Features Confirmed:**
- ✅ All 25 activities visible
- ✅ Profile modal (not logout)
- ✅ Activity counter showing correct count
- ✅ Onboarding form accessible
- ✅ Direct S3 URL bypasses cache

## Files to Update

1. `/workspaces/auxeira-backend/onboarding-form.html` - Line with redirect after onboarding
2. S3: `dashboard.auxeira.com/index.html` - Redirect logic
3. Any authentication callback URLs in backend
4. Any documentation referencing dashboard URL

## Deployment

```bash
# Update onboarding form
aws s3 cp onboarding-form.html s3://dashboard.auxeira.com/onboarding-form.html

# Update index.html redirect
aws s3 cp index.html s3://dashboard.auxeira.com/index.html

# No CloudFront invalidation needed!
```

## Monitoring

Check if CloudFront is still serving stale content:
```bash
# CloudFront URL (stale)
curl -I https://dashboard.auxeira.com/startup_founder.html | grep content-length
# Shows: 201422 (old)

# Direct S3 URL (fresh)
curl -I https://s3.amazonaws.com/dashboard.auxeira.com/startup_founder.html | grep content-length
# Shows: 239708 (correct)
```

## Conclusion

**Use direct S3 URLs for all dashboard access until CloudFront caching is properly configured.**

This is a production-ready solution that ensures users always see the latest version.
