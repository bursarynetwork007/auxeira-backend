            <h3>Compelling Success Stories</h3>
            <div class="story-card">
                <h4>Story 1: Fit for School Programme (Southeast Asia)</h4>
                <p>The Regional Fit for School (FIT) programme supported national and local governments to develop national standards and implementing guidelines for Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) facilities in schools. This initiative has significantly reduced preventable diseases like diarrhea and acute respiratory diseases among school children by promoting daily handwashing with soap and brushing teeth with fluoride toothpaste. The program has been rolled out in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, and the Philippines, reaching millions of students.</p>
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Improved health and learning conditions for millions of primary and secondary school children. Reduced incidence of water-related diseases.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="story-card">
                <h4>Story 2: Enhanced Rural Resilience in Yemen (ERRY)</h4>
                <p>In Yemen, one of the most water-poor countries, the ERRY project addressed challenges by supporting displaced and marginalized youth and women through decentralized solar energy systems. This initiative improved access to energy, employability skills, stable income, and self-confidence. Solar-powered micro-businesses were established, providing sustainable energy and income in remote areas.</p>
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Improved access to sustainable energy and water solutions, leading to economic empowerment and increased resilience for vulnerable communities in Yemen.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="story-card">
