# Activity Rewards System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Activity Rewards System has been fully implemented following the proposed workflow definition. This document summarizes what was built, how to deploy it, and how to test it.

## What Was Built

### 1. Backend API (`/backend/src/routes/activity-rewards.ts`)

Complete REST API with 7 endpoints:

- **GET /api/activities** - Fetch activity catalog with filtering
- **GET /api/activities/:id** - Get specific activity details
- **POST /api/activities/submit** - Submit activity for assessment
- **GET /api/activities/submissions** - Get user's submissions
- **GET /api/activities/submissions/:id** - Get submission details
- **POST /api/activities/calculate-tokens** - Calculate and award tokens
- **GET /api/activities/history** - Get complete activity history

### 2. Database Schema (`/backend/src/database/migrations/005_activity_rewards.sql`)

Four main tables:

- **activities** - Catalog of 25 rewarded activities
- **activity_submissions** - User submissions for assessment
- **token_transactions** - All token movements
- **token_balances** - Current token balance per user/startup

Plus:
- Automated triggers for balance updates
- Views for leaderboards and statistics
- Seed data for all 25 activities

### 3. Frontend Dashboard (`/startup_founder.html`)

Complete three-tab interface:

- **Submit Activity** - Activity selection with 4-step progress tracker
- **Assess Submissions** - Admin assessment queue
- **Activity History** - Complete activity tracking and token totals

### 4. API Client (`/activity-rewards-api-client.js`)

JavaScript client library for frontend integration with:
- All API methods wrapped in easy-to-use functions
- Error handling and authentication
- Example usage and integration patterns

### 5. Documentation

- **ACTIVITY_REWARDS_API.md** - Complete API documentation
- **ACTIVITY_REWARDS_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - This file
- Inline code comments and JSDoc

## Workflow Implementation

The system implements the 5-step workflow:

```
Step 1: Nudge/Selection
├─ Frontend: Activity feed displays 25 activities
├─ Backend: GET /api/activities
└─ Output: Personalized list filtered by startup stage

Step 2: Submission
├─ Frontend: Activity submission form
├─ Backend: POST /api/activities/submit
└─ Output: Submission ID with "pending" status

Step 3: Assessment
├─ Backend: AI Agent processes proof (to be implemented)
├─ Process: NLP/Vision analysis generates quality_score
└─ Output: quality_score (0.0-1.0) and consistency_weeks

Step 4: Calculation
├─ Backend: POST /api/activities/calculate-tokens
├─ Algorithm: base_tokens × quality_bonus × stage_multiplier × consistency_bonus
└─ Output: final_tokens and detailed breakdown

Step 5: Award/Display
├─ Backend: Token balance updated in database
├─ Frontend: GET /api/activities/history
└─ Output: "Activity Complete" with awarded tokens
```

## Token Calculation Algorithm

Implemented exactly as specified in `EconomicsCalc.py`:

```javascript
final_tokens = base_tokens × quality_bonus × stage_multiplier × consistency_bonus
```

### Quality Bonus
- < 0.7: 1.0x (no bonus)
- 0.7-0.85: 1.2x
- ≥ 0.85: 1.5x

### Stage Multiplier
- Pre-Seed: 1.5x
- Seed: 1.3x
- Series A: 1.1x
- Series B: 0.9x
- Series C: 0.8x
- Growth: 0.7x
- Late-Stage: 0.6x

### Consistency Bonus
- 4 weeks: 1.0x
- 8 weeks: 1.1x
- 12 weeks: 1.25x
- 24 weeks: 1.5x
- 52 weeks: 2.0x

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Setup

```bash
# Option A: Using the migration script
cd /workspaces/auxeira-backend/backend
node run-migration.js

# Option B: Using psql directly
psql -U postgres -d auxeira_central -f src/database/migrations/005_activity_rewards.sql
```

This will:
- Create 4 tables (activities, activity_submissions, token_transactions, token_balances)
- Seed 25 activities with descriptions and nudges
- Set up triggers for automatic balance updates
- Create views for leaderboards and statistics

### 2. Backend Server

```bash
cd /workspaces/auxeira-backend/backend

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Start the server
npm start

# Or for development with auto-reload
npm run dev
```

The server will start on port 3000 (or PORT environment variable).

### 3. Frontend Dashboard

The dashboard is already deployed to:
- **S3**: `s3://auxeira-dashboards-jsx-1759943238/startup_founder.html`
- **CloudFront**: `https://dashboard.auxeira.com/startup_founder.html`

To update:
```bash
aws s3 cp startup_founder.html s3://auxeira-dashboards-jsx-1759943238/startup_founder.html --content-type "text/html"
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id E1L1Q8VK3LAEFC --paths "/startup_founder.html"
```

### 4. Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in `/backend/.env`:

```env
# Database
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=auxeira_central
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password_here

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here

# API
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

## Testing

### 1. API Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Auxeira SSE Backend is healthy",
  "features": {
    "activityRewards": true
  }
}
```

### 2. Get Activities

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/activities \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

Expected: List of 25 activities

### 3. Submit Activity

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/activities/submit \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "activity_id": 1,
    "proof_text": "Conducted 5 customer interviews with detailed notes. Key insights: customers struggle with onboarding complexity. Documented pain points and validated our solution hypothesis.",
    "proof_urls": ["https://example.com/notes.pdf"]
  }'
```

Expected: Submission created with "pending" status

### 4. Calculate Tokens

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/activities/calculate-tokens \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "submission_id": "YOUR_SUBMISSION_UUID",
    "quality_score": 0.9,
    "consistency_weeks": 4
  }'
```

Expected: Tokens calculated and awarded

### 5. Get Activity History

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/activities/history \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

Expected: Complete activity history with totals

### 6. Frontend Testing

1. Open: `https://dashboard.auxeira.com/startup_founder.html`
2. Navigate to "Activity Rewards" tab
3. Test three sub-tabs:
   - Submit Activity
   - Assess Submissions
   - Activity History

## Integration Points

### 1. Authentication

All API endpoints require JWT authentication. Users must:
1. Login via `/api/auth/login`
2. Receive JWT token
3. Include token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header

### 2. AI Assessment (To Be Implemented)

The AI assessment step is currently a placeholder. To complete:

1. Create AI service endpoint (e.g., using Claude API)
2. Process submission proof_text and proof_urls
3. Generate quality_score (0.0-1.0)
4. Call `/api/activities/calculate-tokens` with score

Example AI service integration:

```javascript
// In activity-rewards.ts, after submission creation
async function triggerAIAssessment(submissionId, proofText, proofUrls) {
  // Call AI service
  const aiResponse = await fetch('https://ai-service.auxeira.com/assess', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ proof_text: proofText, proof_urls: proofUrls })
  });
  
  const { quality_score } = await aiResponse.json();
  
  // Calculate tokens
  await fetch('/api/activities/calculate-tokens', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ submission_id: submissionId, quality_score })
  });
}
```

### 3. Frontend API Integration

Include the API client in your dashboard:

```html
<script src="activity-rewards-api-client.js"></script>
<script>
  // Initialize API client
  const api = new ActivityRewardsAPI('https://api.auxeira.com', userToken);
  
  // Initialize dashboard
  const dashboard = new ActivityRewardsDashboard(api);
  dashboard.initialize();
</script>
```
