- **v2**: 150-200 words (250 absolute max)
- **Result**: More concise, focused responses

#### 2. **Better Structure**

- **Result**: Cleaner, easier to follow

#### 3. **Quality Gates**
- **v2 Added**: Self-check checklist before sending
- Must use 3+ specific numbers
- Must explain WHY metrics matter with math
- Must have specific actions with timeframes
- **Result**: Consistent high-quality responses

#### 4. **More Specific Math**
- **v1**: "Your churn is concerning"
- **v2**: "At 2.3% monthly churn, your 1,247-customer base shrinks to 964 by month 18, costing $6.5K in lost MRR"
- **Result**: Founders see exact impact

#### 6. **Better Action Format**
- **v1**: Vague actions
- **v2**: [Timeframe] → [Specific action] → [Expected outcome]

- **Result**: Founders know exactly what to do

## Example Comparison

### Same Question: "My churn rate is 2.3%. How can I reduce it?"

#### v1 Response (Old)
```
I hear your frustration - it's tough to see high churn even as you gain new customers. 
The numbers show you've built a product people want to try, but something isn't clicking 
for them to stick around. At 12% weekly churn, you're burning cash on acquisition without 
seeing the compounding benefits of loyal users. But the 42 NPS score suggests there's an 
underlying demand you can unlock.

The key here is to get laser-focused on your most valuable customers - the ones who see 
lasting value in your product. Rather than optimizing for volume, it's time to zoom in 
on the qualitative "why" behind your NPS leaders...

[continues for 508 words]
```

**Issues**:
- ❌ Too long (508 words vs 200 target)
- ❌ Vague numbers ("high churn")
- ❌ No specific math shown
- ❌ Actions lack timeframes
- ❌ Corporate language ("it's time to zoom in")

#### v2 Response (New)
```
**Reality Check:** 
$18.5K MRR in month 11—that's 14% month-over-month growth. Impressive. But at 2.3% 
monthly churn, your 1,247-customer base shrinks to 964 by month 18, costing $6.5K in 
lost MRR. Churn under 3% is table stakes for Series A SaaS.

**The Insight:**
You don't have a churn problem—you have an activation problem. Users sign up but fail 
to become habitual, sticky customers. The culprit? Your onboarding experience is likely 
overengineered for "power users" instead of your median customer.

**The Action:**
This week:
- Identify the 3-5 critical steps where 50%+ of users drop off. Map the full onboarding journey.
- Interview 5 churned users. Ask: "What nearly convinced you to stay?" Surfaces your 20% 
  of features driving 80% of value.
- Ruthlessly cut onboarding down to only those core features. Test a streamlined flow on 
  new signups.

**Question + Nudge:**
If you could only fix one thing in 30 days, what would it be—and why haven't you started? 
Time to make onboarding un-ignorable.
```

**Improvements**:
- ✅ Concise (313 tokens, ~200 words)
- ✅ Specific numbers (2.3%, 1,247 → 964, $6.5K)
- ✅ Math shown (calculates impact)
- ✅ Actions with timeframes ("This week")
- ✅ Direct language ("Time to make onboarding un-ignorable")
- ✅ Provocative question (forces prioritization)

## Quality Gates (Built-in)

Every v2 response must pass:
- [ ] Uses 3+ specific numbers from metrics
- [ ] Explains WHY metrics matter with math
- [ ] Actions specific enough to start in 24 hours
- [ ] Question forces prioritization
- [ ] Tone is warm + direct (not corporate)
- [ ] Under 200 words (250 max)
- [ ] Founder feels seen, understood, mobilized

## Geographic Context Examples

### Africa (Lagos)
**v2 includes**:
- Mobile-first considerations (2G networks)
- Payment methods (M-Pesa, mobile money)
- Infrastructure challenges (load-shedding)
- Funding realities (smaller rounds, longer gaps)

**Example**: "In Lagos, your onboarding needs to work on 2G with spotty power. Test on a $50 Android phone, not your MacBook."

### North America (Austin)
**v2 includes**:
- Hyper-competition, saturated markets
- High CAC expectations
- Fast funding cycles
- "Grow fast or die" culture

**Example**: "In Austin, 3 VC offers sounds great until you realize they all want you to 10x ad spend. Run the CAC math first."

## Industry Context Examples

### FinTech
**v2 includes**:
- Compliance costs (KYC, AML)
- Trust barriers
- Banking partnerships
- Hidden CAC (compliance adds $30/user)

**Example**: "Your CAC is $50, but KYC compliance adds $30 per user. Real CAC: $80."

### EdTech
**v2 includes**:
- Long sales cycles (schools buy annually)
- Multiple stakeholders (teachers, admins, parents)
- Low willingness to pay
- Efficacy measurement challenges
