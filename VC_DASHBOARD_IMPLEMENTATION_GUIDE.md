// Risk Calculation
const riskWeights = { low: 1, medium: 2, high: 3 };
const avgRisk = selectedSectors.reduce((sum, s) => sum + riskWeights[s.risk], 0) / selectedSectors.length;
const riskScore = Math.round((avgRisk / 3) * 100);

// IRR Calculation
const avgGrowth = selectedSectors.reduce((sum, s) => sum + s.growth, 0) / selectedSectors.length;
const riskAdjustment = avgRisk * 2;
const baseIRR = Math.max(0, avgGrowth * 0.8 - riskAdjustment * 0.7);
```

### âœ… Phase 2: Code Cleanup

**Removed**:
- Integration & Workflow Enhancements section (lines 1572-1607)

2. Update API keys in environment variables
3. Test all features in staging environment
4. Deploy to production server
5. Monitor error logs
6. Collect user feedback

## Customization

### Changing Sector Data

Edit the sector chips in the HTML:

```html
<div class="sector-chip" draggable="true" 
     data-sector="YOUR_SECTOR" 
     data-growth="XX" 
     data-risk="low|medium|high">
    <i class="fas fa-icon"></i>
    <span>Sector Name</span>
    <small class="d-block">XX% growth</small>
</div>
```

### Adjusting IRR Formulas

Modify the `calculateRiskAndIRR()` function:

```javascript
const conservativeIRR = Math.max(0, avgGrowth * 0.6 - riskAdjustment);
const baseIRR = Math.max(0, avgGrowth * 0.8 - riskAdjustment * 0.7);
const optimisticIRR = avgGrowth * 1.2 - riskAdjustment * 0.5;
```

### Styling

All colors are defined in CSS variables:

```css
:root {
    --accent-blue: #3b82f6;
    --accent-purple: #8b5cf6;
    --accent-green: #10b981;
    --accent-red: #ef4444;
    --accent-gold: #FFD700;
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Drag-and-Drop Not Working

**Issue**: Sectors don't drag to canvas  
**Solution**: Ensure JavaScript is enabled and `draggable="true"` attribute is set

### Risk Score Not Calculating

**Issue**: Risk score shows "-"  
**Solution**: Check that sectors have valid `data-risk` attributes (low/medium/high)

### Modal Not Opening

**Issue**: Upload modal doesn't appear  
**Solution**: Verify Bootstrap JS is loaded and modal ID matches

### AI Suggestions Not Appearing

**Issue**: No suggestions shown  
**Solution**: Add at least one sector to trigger suggestion logic

## Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation**: All form inputs are validated client-side and should be validated server-side
2. **File Upload**: Implement server-side file type and size validation
3. **XSS Prevention**: Sanitize all user inputs before displaying
4. **CSRF Protection**: Implement CSRF tokens for form submissions
5. **API Authentication**: Secure all API endpoints with proper authentication

## Support & Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

- Update sector growth rates quarterly
- Review AI suggestion logic monthly
- Monitor user feedback weekly
- Update documentation as needed

### Known Issues

None at this time.

### Feature Requests

Track feature requests in GitHub Issues.
