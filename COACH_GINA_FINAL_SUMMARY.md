## üìä Context-Aware Responses

Coach Gina receives the following context from the dashboard:

```javascript
{
    stage: 'Series A',
    industry: 'FinTech',
    geography: 'United States',
    teamSize: 12,
    runway: 14,
    mrr: 18500,
    customers: 1247,
    cac: 127,
    ltv: 1890,
    churnRate: 2.3,
    nps: 68,
    recentMilestones: [
        'Achieved $18.5K MRR',
        'Reduced CAC by 15.2%',
        'Reached 1,247 customers'
    ],
    activeChallenges: [
        'Churn rate above SaaS benchmark',

        'Financial model needs updating'
    ]
}

## üéØ Example Conversation

**Founder**: "My churn rate is 2.3%. How can I reduce it?"

**Coach Gina**:
```
I see you're at 2.3% monthly churn‚Äîabove the SaaS benchmark of 1-2%. 
That's costing you roughly $50K in annual revenue. Here's how to fix it:

**This week**: Interview 5 churned customers. Ask "What nearly made you stay?"
**Daily for 7 days**: Review your top 10 retained customers. What's different?
**By Friday**: Map your user journey. Circle where users ghost.

If you drop churn to 1.5%, you'll add $50K ARR and boost your Series A 
readiness from 78% to 85%+.

What's stopping you from starting those churn interviews today?
```
